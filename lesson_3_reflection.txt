When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

    When you want to work with multiple computers instead of doing everything just on one or when you want multiple people to work on a project with you.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

    Because sometimes you might have made a change on your remote that you don't want replacing your current local and sometimes you may want to save your current local before it automatically being replaced by the remote.
