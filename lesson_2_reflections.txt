What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

    When you initialize a repository, Git puts together your files and informs you that your files will not be in a new repository with the path the files are currently in based on where they're stored on your computer.

    This is necessary because otherwise Git would not know what files belong to your repository.
